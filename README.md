# very-basic-landing-page
I used HTML,JS,CSS.
This is a multi-section landing page, which creates dynamically navigation menu in corresponding to the amount of sections that are added to the page.
While navigating or scrolling down through the page, the section that in the viewport get special style. This page also support smooth navigations via sections when the appropriate link is clicked.
